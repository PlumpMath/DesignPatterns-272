# Design Patterns

Implementation of all the design patterns found on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) in C# using .NET v4.0. The code was developed on Linux & Windows and so has been tested with both the Windows .NET runtime and Mono.

The inspiration for this was to look at each design pattern and understand it by using a custom example. However, this does not apply to all of the patterns due to a lack of imagination.
